            <h3>What did you find confusing?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Plan fixed fee doesn't work with quantity, but after checking the documentation we realized that is the intended behavior. Maybe we need to add a better explanation on Instruments.</li>
                <li>Shipping didn't work at all.</li>
                <li>Shipping rates didn't work no matter the conditions we added, we checked the <code>preview-purchase</code> response and all the properties related to shipping seemed to be the default ones.</li>
                <li>
                    <p>We removed all conditions from the shipping rate, to make sure shipping was working, but the response from <code>preview-purchase</code> was not what we expected. <code>shippingRates</code> did have some information, but <code>shippingAmount</code> was 0 no matter what. After checking the code on <code>Instruments</code> we noticed that the shipping rates was bound to the <code>shippingAmount</code> property.</p>
